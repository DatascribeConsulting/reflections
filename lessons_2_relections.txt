git init: how to make something into a git repository (makes no commits at first)
git status: tells you branch, commits and untracked files

Staging area: before you commit changes, add files to this and then commit them.
Helps to separate files.

git add: add files to the staging area

git diff (no arguments): compare working directory to staging area
git diff --staged: compare staging area and commit 1
git diff commit1 commit2: compare 2 commits

use staging area to make sure to have 1 commit per logical change by using diff commands:
1) make change, will show up in git diff (no arguments), no changed in git diff --staged
2) git add, change will show up in diff --staged, no changes in git diff
