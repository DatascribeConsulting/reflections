I used diff -u oldfile newfile
to compare 2 files, + was before each line that was added, 
- before each line taken away. 

It is important to save versions to find mistakes

It will be harder to remember to save files at important points, 
but nice that saving a file will not overwrite it.

Manual saving is a nice thing, since you can commit only after making a large change.
However, changes that are logically seperable should be commited individually.
Google docs probably saves too many changes.
Saving multiple files in one commit is very helpful for related files! 
	Especially websites with HTML and CSS files

Git was already installed. Version 2. something
git log shows all the commits with some messeges 
git diff shows insertions and deletions 
color change was nice to show insertions as green and deletions as red
what happens if you only change one word in a line?

repository= collection of files tracked by git. 
Repositories can interact with each other

git clone copies an existing repository

HEAD= current commit you are working on
detach head by switching to previous commit
